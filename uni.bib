  abstract     = {Collocation candidate extraction from dependency-annotated corpora has become more and more mainstream in collocation research over the past years. In most studies, however, the results of one parser are compared to those of relatively ``dumb'' window-based approaches only. To date, the impact of the parser used and its parsing scheme has not been studied systematically to the best of our knowledge. This chapter evaluates a total of 8 parsers on 2 corpora with 20 different association measures plus several frequency thresholds for 6 different types of collocations against the Oxford Collocations Dictionary for Students of English (2nd edition; 2009). We find that the parser and parsing scheme both play a role in the quality of the collocation candidate extraction. The performance of different parsers can differ substantially across different collocation types. The filters used to extract different types of collocations from the corpora also play an important role in the trade-off between precision and recall we can observe. Furthermore, we find that carefully sampled and balanced corpora (such as the BNC) seem to have considerable advantages in precision, but of course for total coverage, larger, less balanced corpora (such as the web corpus used in this study) take the lead. Overall, log-likelihood is the best association measure, but for some specific types of collocation (such as adjective-noun or verb-adverb), other measures perform even better.},

Our results and theoretical analysis suggest that ambiguity is a functional property of language that allows for greater communicative efficiency. This provides theoretical and empirical arguments against recent suggestions that core features of linguistic systems are not designed for communication.}

For example, the wordform “bark” can denote either the sound produced by a dog or the protective outer sheath of a tree trunk. Why would a system evolved for efficient, effective communication display rampant ambiguity? Some accounts argue that ambiguity is actually a design feature of human communication systems, allowing languages to recycle their most optimal wordforms (those which are short, frequent, and phonotactically well-formed) for multiple meanings. We test this claim by constructing five series of artificial lexica matched for the phonotactics and distribution of word lengths found in five real languages (English, German, Dutch, French, and Japanese), and comparing both the quantity and concentration of homophony across the real and artificial lexica. Surprisingly, we find that the artificial lexica exhibit higher upper-bounds on homophony than their real counterparts, and that homophony is even more likely to be found among short, phonotactically plausible wordforms in the artificial than in the real lexica. These results suggest that homophony in real languages is not directly selected for, but rather, that it emerges as a natural consequence of other features of a language. In fact, homophony may even be selected against in real languages, producing lexica that better conform to other requirements of humans who need to use them. Finally, we explore the hypothesis that this is achieved by “smoothing” out dense concentrations of homophones across lexical neighborhoods, resulting in comparatively more minimal pairs in real lexica.}

  abstract     = {Abstract Lexical ambiguity—the phenomenon of a single word having multiple, distinguishable senses—is pervasive in language. Both the degree of ambiguity of a word (roughly, its number of senses) and the relatedness of those senses have been found to have widespread effects on language acquisition and processing. Recently, distributional approaches to semantics, in which a word's meaning is determined by its contexts, have led to successful research quantifying the degree of ambiguity, but these measures have not distinguished between the ambiguity of words with multiple related senses versus multiple unrelated meanings. In this work, we present the first assessment of whether distributional meaning representations can capture the ambiguity structure of a word, including both the number and relatedness of senses. On a very large sample of English words, we find that some, but not all, distributional semantic representations that we test exhibit detectable differences between sets of monosemes (unambiguous words; N = 964), polysemes (with multiple related senses; N = 4,096), and homonyms (with multiple unrelated senses; N = 355). Our findings begin to answer open questions from earlier work regarding whether distributional semantic representations of words, which successfully capture various semantic relationships, also reflect fine-grained aspects of meaning structure that influence human behavior. Our findings emphasize the importance of measuring whether proposed lexical representations capture such distinctions: In addition to standard benchmarks that test the similarity structure of distributional semantic models, we need to also consider whether they have cognitively plausible ambiguity structure.},

  abstract     = {Homonyms are words that share their spelling but differ in meaning and are a common feature in most languages. Homonyms are a source of noise i most text analyses and are difficult to detect; numerous studies have been conducted in this regard. However, extant methods typically detect homonyms using a rule-based or statistical-based approach, which requires an answer set, with little regard to the semantic meaning of the word. Therefore, we propose a novel approach for the detection of homonyms based on contextual word embedding that allows a word to be understood based on the context in which it appears. In this study, we extracted all contextual word embedding vectors of individual words and clustered those vectors using a spherical k-means clustering to detect pairs of homonyms. In addition, we developed a homonym replacement method to increase the performance of a document embedding technique, based on the word vector value. We replaced the embedding vectors of homonyms with a representative vector based on the respective meaning using the proposed homonym detection method. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method effectively detects homonyms and significantly improves the performance of document embedding.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a general class of regression models for continuous proportions when the data contain zeros or ones. The proposed class of models assumes that the response variable has a mixed continuous–discrete distribution with probability mass at zero or one. The beta distribution is used to describe the continuous component of the model, since its density has a wide range of different shapes depending on the values of the two parameters that index the distribution. We use a suitable parameterization of the beta law in terms of its mean and a precision parameter. The parameters of the mixture distribution are modeled as functions of regression parameters. We provide inference, diagnostic, and model selection tools for this class of models. A practical application that employs real data is presented.}
