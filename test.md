We present a general information-theoretic argument that all efficient communication sys-tems will be ambiguous, assuming that context is informative about meaning. We alsoargue that ambiguity allows for greater ease of processing by permitting efficient linguisticunits to be re-used. We test predictions of this theory in English, German, and Dutch. Ourresults and theoretical analysis suggest that ambiguity is a functional property of languagethat allows for greater communicative efficiency. This provides theoretical and empiricalarguments against recent suggestions that core features of linguistic systems are notdesigned for communication
