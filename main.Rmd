# Introduction

Ambiguity is pervasive in language. blablabla

Conversion is a productive process that inevitably produces homophones.
Additionally, noun-verb and verb-noun conversions are doubly homophonous with inflectional affixes in *-s*.

The emergence of lexical clusters is conditioned by frequency.
Various studies have provided evidence [review in @diessel16]

# Avoiding Ambiguity

formal equivalence
homonymy and polysemy

that deletion is not permitted in non-extraposed subject clauses
@wasow15

(@) This  paper demonstrates that the differences in duration of English final S as a function of the morphological function it expresses.

## Brainstorm

Hypothesis: third person singular -s is avoided in noun-verb conversion
take a polysemous word and gather identical n-grams

## Literature

Studies like @plag17 call into question whether there is perfect homonymy between different types of word final *-s*. The study found significant length differences, and hypothesizes that
@song_et_al13 did not find any such effect, however, albeit on a more lexically restricted study.

In a more recent study, @tomaschek_et_al21 show that length of final *-s* can be modelled as having a discriminatory function depending on the lexical and phonological context.
In other words, the duration was found to decrease with increasing contextual ambiguity. <!-- TODO: this doesn't sound right-->
"Energy is not invested in a signal that creates confusion instead of clarity." [@tomaschek_et_al21, p. 154]
This points to some degree of ambiguity sensitivity, even though it is not entirely clear what it means for ambiguity avoidance.

Systematic phonetic differences potentially contribute to the disambiguation

@wasow15 surveys a variety of studies ...
and concludes that ambiguity avoidance has not been shown to be as common as
expected considering the pervasiveness of ambiguities in language.
Grice underestimated the pervasiveness of ambiguity.
Provides an attempt at a taximony.
- word order freezing as ambiguity avoidance
- that deletion only in unambiguous syntactic context
- German free syntax but default SVO reading.
    Wasow does not call it default.

@piantadosi_et_al12

@trott+bergen20:
Linguistic forms are expected to show a certain degree of ambiguity in order to provide an efficient system.
Simulations suggest that ambiguity caused by homophony is more common in natural languages than expected, even when taking into account.
<!-- TODO: figure out how expected homophone ratios are calculated -->
Homophones are smoothed out in lexically neighboring areas.

Recently, word embedding techniques have been used for various lexical tasks.
@beekhuizen_et_al21:
word2vec for distinguishing polysemes from homonyms?

@lee21
In combination with contextual word embeddings, clustering techniques have been
used to detect homonymy.

# Considerations

Textual co-occurrence can only serve as an upper bound.
Prosodic markers in spoken language can further disambiguate most types of ambiguity.
The same is true for more general types of background knowledge.

# Methodology

## Textual specificity

Two types of dispersion are used here.
One is the deviation of proportions across texts (DP.norm) [@gries08], more specifically the normalized version [cf. @lijffijt+gries12].
DP.norm is a corpus-part-based measure bound between 0 and 1.
Values close to 1 indicate a high deviation, therefore a low dispersion. It can be interpreted as a measure of how evenly tokens are spread over the corpus parts.
It cannot account for short bursts of occurrences (example?), therefore, word growth dispersion (DWG) [@zimmermann20] is used as well, which is based on distances between occurrences.
DWG is a measure of how regularly a token occurs across an entire corpus occurs across an entire corpus.

If ambiguity is regularly avoided, it should be expected that with growing word class ambiguity, the use of *-s* becomes more context-dependent.
Considering a given dispersion or "clumpiness" of contexts in which a lexeme is likely to occur,
the existence of avoidance-contexts should cause a penalty to dispersion and make the distribution clumpier.

Problem:
The contexts in which ambiguity is avoided/not avoided might be rather evenly dispersed themselves.
This could mask potential clumpiness of *-s* occurrences.

It is difficult to identify avoidance contexts formally.
Lexical and syntactical correlates of the avoided structure might be avoided as a side effect, and cause fuzzier overall differences in structure.

## Lexical specificity

As a simple measure the productiviy index [@baayen]

# Conclusion

Include more contextual and "world knowledge" information, such as images [e.g. @kottur16; @shahmohammadi21].
Recent advances in context embedding might provide tools to further test where real ambiguity exists and where it affects the system of language.

There are no significant differences in spread and frequency of *-s* in lexical forms that occur as verb-noun or noun-verb conversions. (???)
